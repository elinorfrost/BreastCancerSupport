# Breast Cancer Support
### Elinor Frost

### Overview
A project where I learn basic web scraping to collect data for potential machine learning or statistical modelling projects.
I plan to scrape user posts and comments from the *SHARE Metastatic Breast Cancer* page within *Health Unlocked*, a support forum for people to share their experiences and find community with individuals who experience similar disease and illnesses.

#### Files
`pull_data.py`: a file to extract data from web pages
`scratch.py`: a place to put code as I learn web scraping
